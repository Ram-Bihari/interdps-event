Design strategies & techniques
According to FutureLearn,[83][better source needed] the following design strategies and techniques can be applied to make fast fashion more sustainable:

Zero Waste Pattern Cutting: This technique eliminates potential textile waste right at the design stage, where the pattern pieces are strategically laid like a jigsaw puzzle onto a precisely measured piece of fabric.
Minimal Seam Construction: This technique allows faster manufacturing time by lessening the number of seams that are necessary to stitch a garment.
Design for Disassembly (DfD): The main intention of this strategy involves designing a product in such a way that it can be easily taken apart at the end of its lifespan and this allows the use of fewer materials.
Craft preservation: This technique combines and incorporates ancestral craft techniques into modern designs and in a way it ensures preservation of traditional craftsmanship through innovation.
Transformational/Multifunctional: This strategy can be used to design products or garments that could be worn in numerous ways and can even have elements that are reversible. The best real-life example is the Carry on Closet fashion line created and developed by Antithesis.[84][better source needed]
Pull Factor Framework: Brands such as L.L Bean and Harvey Nichols implemented a "Pull Factor Framework" which is a new methodology that strives to make sustainable innovation more enticing for consumers and producers alike
