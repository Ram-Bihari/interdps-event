Design strategies & techniques
According to FutureLearn,[83][better source needed] the following design strategies and techniques can be applied to make fast fashion more sustainable:

Zero Waste Pattern Cutting: This technique eliminates potential textile waste right at the design stage, where the pattern pieces are strategically laid like a jigsaw puzzle onto a precisely measured piece of fabric.
Minimal Seam Construction: This technique allows faster manufacturing time by lessening the number of seams that are necessary to stitch a garment.
Design for Disassembly (DfD): The main intention of this strategy involves designing a product in such a way that it can be easily taken apart at the end of its lifespan and this allows the use of fewer materials.
Craft preservation: This technique combines and incorporates ancestral craft techniques into modern designs and in a way it ensures preservation of traditional craftsmanship through innovation.
Transformational/Multifunctional: This strategy can be used to design products or garments that could be worn in numerous ways and can even have elements that are reversible. The best real-life example is the Carry on Closet fashion line created and developed by Antithesis.[84][better source needed]
Pull Factor Framework: Brands such as L.L Bean and Harvey Nichols implemented a "Pull Factor Framework" which is a new methodology that strives to make sustainable innovation more enticing for consumers and producers alike


Fast fashion has taken the world by storm in the last few decades. It is a trend that emphasizes rapid production, quick turnover, and low prices. Fast fashion brands such as Zara, H&M, and Forever 21 have become household names, and their products are available in every major city in the world. However, the cost of fast fashion is much higher than what we pay for it. The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world after oil and gas, and fast fashion is a significant contributor to this pollution.

Fast fashion is a business model that emphasizes quick and cheap production of clothes to meet the rapidly changing fashion trends. It relies on a global network of suppliers and manufacturers who produce clothes at a low cost, and these clothes are then sold at low prices. The goal of fast fashion is to provide consumers with new and trendy clothes every few weeks, encouraging them to buy more and more. The production of fast fashion is based on the principles of planned obsolescence, which means that clothes are designed to be worn a few times before they fall apart or go out of style.

The fast fashion industry is responsible for a significant amount of pollution and waste. The production of clothes requires a vast amount of natural resources, including water, energy, and raw materials. The textile dyeing and finishing industry is one of the largest polluters of water globally. The chemicals used in the production of clothes, such as dyes and bleaches, are toxic and can cause harm to the environment.

Human Rights Violations: The fast fashion industry relies heavily on cheap labour, which often leads to human rights violations. Workers in the textile industry are often subjected to long hours, low wages, and unsafe working conditions. In India, the garment industry is notorious for exploiting women and children, who are often forced to work in sweatshops.

The Impact of Fast Fashion on Garment Workers

Economic Impact: Fast fashion has a negative impact on the local economy, particularly in developing countries like India. The industry is dominated by a few large multinational corporations that have a monopoly on the market. These corporations often dictate the terms of trade, leading to unfair wages and working conditions for workers.
